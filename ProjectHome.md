  * 2014-05-13: JNIBWAPI 1.0 is released. Includes significant changes to the API to bring it closer to the C++ API and encourage type safety.
  * 2014-02-09: JNIBWAPI 0.4 is now [available for download](https://drive.google.com/a/soe.ucsc.edu/folderview?id=0Bxdd3L2Qj5lxamZUSUpOLVZ6c2M) on  Google Drive. Google Code no longer hosts new downloads.
  * 2013-07-18: JNIBWAPI 0.3 is released. C++ dependencies are included in the release so that the client-bridge DLL can be changed and recompiled. Main package renamed to JNIBWAPI.
  * 2012-06-24: Now compatible with BWAPI 3.7.X . Download the current release package or use source checkout to get the latest bugfixes / improvements.

## Overview ##

This project provides a JNI interface for the [Brood War API](http://code.google.com/p/bwapi/) using the shared memory bridge. Compatible with BWAPI 3.6 and available under the LGPL. This project provides a Java interface for developers interested in participating in the [StarCraft AI Competition](http://www.starcraftaicompetition.com/).

The JNI interface provides several advantages over the previous socket-based [ProxyBot](http://eis.ucsc.edu/StarCraftRemote) interface. First, the interface uses the BWAPI shared memory bridge which lessens the communication bottleneck between C++ and Java and prevents cheating using direct memory access. Second, the BWAPI utility functions (e.g. canBuildHere) can be now be called from Java. Finally, the use of JNI should result in easier project maintainability and extensibility.
