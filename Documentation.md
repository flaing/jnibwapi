# Documentation #

JNIBWAPI aims to closely mimic the API of [BWAPI](https://code.google.com/p/bwapi/) (version 3.7.4).

Therefore, **the best place to look for documentation** is in the **[BWAPI documentation](https://code.google.com/p/bwapi/wiki/OldDocumentation)**.

If anything in JNIBWAPI does not work as expected according to the BWAPI documentation, please file a bug report on the issues page.

Note: JNIBWAPI currently makes heavy use of IDs where objects are used in BWAPI. This should be remedied soon.
